Hi, I'm Daniel.  
I like Heavy Metal and (mostly oldish) computer games.  
I write code, usually gamedev/Linux centric (often both).
Sometimes I write about that. In this Blog.

Some for-fun/free-time projects I'm involved with:

* [**Yamagi Quake II**](https://www.yamagi.org/quake2/) ([also on Github](https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2))
  co-maintaining, OpenGL3 renderer, ...
* [**dhewm3**](https://dhewm3.org), a source port of Doom 3: maintaining
* [**RBDoom3BFG**](https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG/), much of the porting 
  to Linux + SDL
* [**Daikatana 1.3**](https://bitbucket.org/daikatana13/daikatana)
  port to Linux (and partly Mac OSX) with SDL+OpenAL, several bugfixes
* [**Snippets**](https://github.com/DanielGibson/Snippets/) some header-only
  public domain libs (for C/C++) + other (hopefully) useful code snippets I wrote

## Licenses of this Blog

The source of this blog can be found at https://github.com/DanielGibson/DanielGibson.github.io/
It's built with hugo and uses python-pygmentize for the syntax-highlighted codeblocks.

### Theme

Feel free to use my modifications to the lithium theme - I don't really care about any specific
license for them, but the original lithium theme is under MIT license, so I guess so are my changes.  
Of special interest may be [this](https://github.com/DanielGibson/DanielGibson.github.io/blob/source/themes/lithium/layouts/_default/single.html#L27-L45)
and [this](https://github.com/DanielGibson/DanielGibson.github.io/blob/source/themes/lithium/static/js/github-comments.js)
for Github based comments (based on [Don Williamson's code](http://donw.io/post/github-comments/#using-github-for-comments)
but adapted to use plain JS instead of JQuery) and
[this little script](https://github.com/DanielGibson/DanielGibson.github.io/blob/source/themes/lithium/layouts/partials/footer.html#L18-L40)
which adds clickable anchors before headings to make it easy for users to link
to that heading (and thus its section).

### Posts

I haven't decided on a license for my posts on this blog yet, so for now assume that they
shouldn't be copied (except for local viewing; *Further Note: in case my blog permanently
vanishes from the internet, feel free to host a backup, but please add a note that I wrote the posts.*).

### Source Code Snippets in Posts

The source code snippets in them however are freely usable however you want,
unless otherwise noted or unless I'm citing existing code (I will make that clear),
in those cases the original licenses apply.  
License for my own code snippets in blog posts:
```text
  This software is dual-licensed to the public domain and under the
  following license: you are granted a perpetual, irrevocable license to
  copy, modify, publish, and distribute this file as you see fit.
  No warranty implied; use at your own risk.
```
So you can do whatever you want with that code, including copying it
(or parts of it) into your own source.
No need to mention me or this "license" in your code or docs, even though
it would be appreciated, of course.

Some projects I'm involved with:

* [**Yamagi Quake II**](https://www.yamagi.org/quake2/) ([also on Github](https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2))
  co-maintaining, OpenGL3 renderer, ...
* [**dhewm3**](https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3/), a source port of Doom 3: maintaining
* [**RBDoom3BFG**](https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG/), much of the porting 
  to Linux + SDL
* [**Daikatana 1.3**](https://bitbucket.org/daikatana13/daikatana)
  port to Linux (and partly Mac OSX) with SDL+OpenAL, several bugfixes
* [**Snippets**](https://github.com/DanielGibson/Snippets/) some header-only
  public domain libs (for C/C++) + other (hopefully) useful code snippets I wrote
